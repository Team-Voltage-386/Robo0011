# Robo0011
 Carl's experiment with designing a new robot template.
 
 The system uses a routine based system, and is designed for non-blocking continous operations. It also fixes the issues that arise from having the subsystems dynamically typed, by making them statically typed.
 
 The idea being that this will make programming more intuitive for future students.
 
 This project currently takes the form of a rewrite of ty22, but once everything is ironed out it will be a bare-bones template with nothing but a template subsystem and routine, as well as perhaps some very, very basic drive code.
